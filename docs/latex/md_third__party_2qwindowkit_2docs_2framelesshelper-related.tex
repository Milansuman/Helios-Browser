\item If DWM composition is disabled in some very rare cases (only possible on Windows 7), the top-\/left corner and top-\/right corner will appear in round shape. The round corners can be restored to square if you re-\/enable DWM composition.
\item There\textquotesingle{}s an Open\+GL driver bug which will cause some frameless windows have a strange black bar right on top of your homemade title bar, and it also makes the controls in your windows shifted to the bottom-\/right corner for some pixels. It\textquotesingle{}s a bug of your graphics card driver, specifically, your Open\+GL driver, not Frameless\+Helper. There are some solutions provided by our users but some of them may not work in all conditions, you can pick one from them\+:

Upgrade the graphics driver   &Try to use a newer driver which may ship with the fix    \\\cline{1-2}
Change the system theme to "{}\+Basic"{} (in contrary to "{}\+Windows Aero"{})   &Let Windows use pure software rendering    \\\cline{1-2}
If there are multiple graphics cards, use another one instead   &Try to use a different driver which may don\textquotesingle{}t have such bug at all    \\\cline{1-2}
Upgrade the system to at least Windows 11   &Windows 11 redesigned the windowing system so the bug can no longer be triggered    \\\cline{1-2}
Remove the {\ttfamily WS\+\_\+\+THICKFRAME} and {\ttfamily WS\+\_\+\+OVERLAPPED} styles from the window, and maybe also add the {\ttfamily WS\+\_\+\+POPUP} style at the same time, and don\textquotesingle{}t do anything inside the {\ttfamily WM\+\_\+\+NCCALCSIZE} block (just return {\ttfamily false} directly or remove/comment out the whole block)   &Try to mirror Qt\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Frameless\+Window\+Hint}\textquotesingle{}s behavior    \\\cline{1-2}
Use {\ttfamily Qt\+::\+Frameless\+Window\+Hint} instead of doing the {\ttfamily WM\+\_\+\+NCCALCSIZE} trick   &Qt\textquotesingle{}s rendering code path is totally different between these two solutions    \\\cline{1-2}
Force Qt to use the ANGLE backend instead of the Desktop Open\+GL   &ANGLE will translate Open\+GL directives into D3D ones    \\\cline{1-2}
Force Qt to use pure software rendering instead of rendering through Open\+GL   &Qt is not using Open\+GL at all    \\\cline{1-2}
Force Qt to use the Mesa 3D libraries instead of normal Open\+GL   &Try to use a different Open\+GL implementation    \\\cline{1-2}
Use Direct3\+D/\+Vulkan/\+Metal instead of Open\+GL   &Just don\textquotesingle{}t use the buggy Open\+GL   \\\cline{1-2}

If you are lucky enough, one of them may fix the issue for you. If not, you may try to use multiple solutions together. {\bfseries{But I can\textquotesingle{}t guarantee the issue can 100\% be fixed.}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Due to there are many sub-\/versions of Windows 10, it\textquotesingle{}s highly recommended to use the latest version of Windows 10, at least {\bfseries{no older than Windows 10 1809}}. If you try to use this framework on some very old Windows 10 versions such as 1507 or 1607, there may be some compatibility issues. Using this framework on Windows 7 is also supported but not recommended. To get the most stable behavior and the best appearance, you should use it on the latest version of Windows 10 or Windows 11.
\item To make the snap layout work as expected, there are some additional rules for your homemade system buttons to follow\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Add a manifest file to your application. In the manifest file, you need to claim your application supports Windows 11 explicitly. This step is VERY VERY IMPORTANT. Without this step, the snap layout feature can\textquotesingle{}t be enabled.}}
\item Call {\ttfamily set\+System\+Button()} for each button (it can be any {\itshape QWidget} or {\itshape QQuick\+Item}) to let Frameless\+Helper know which is the minimize/maximize/close button.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Frameless\+Helper will force your application to use the {\itshape XCB} platform plugin when running on Wayland.
\item The resize area is inside of the window.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/wangwenx190}{\texttt{ Yuhang Zhao}}\+: Help me create this project. This project is mainly based on his code.
\item \href{https://github.com/JulienMaille}{\texttt{ Julien}}\+: Help me test this library on many various environments and help me fix the bugs we found. Contributed many code to improve this library. The \doxylink{classMainWindow}{Main\+Window} example is mostly based on his code.
\item \href{https://github.com/altairwei}{\texttt{ Altair Wei}}\+: Help me fix quite some small bugs and give me many important suggestions, the 2.\+x version is also inspired by his idea during our discussions.
\item \href{https://github.com/MouriNaruto}{\texttt{ Kenji Mouri}}\+: Give me a lot of help on Win32 native developing.
\item \href{https://github.com/mentalfl0w}{\texttt{ Dylan Liu}}\+: Help me improve the build process on mac\+OS.
\item \href{https://github.com/SineStriker}{\texttt{ Sine\+Striker}}\+: Spent over a whole week helping me improve the Snap Layout implementation, fixing potential bugs and also give me a lot of professional and useful suggestions. Without his great effort, the new implementation may never come.
\item And also thanks to other contributors not listed here! Without their valuable help, this library wouldn\textquotesingle{}t have such good quality and user experience!
